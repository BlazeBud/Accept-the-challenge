# Job page testing scenario

## An approach to creating test cases
To create test cases for the IBS vacancies page, I analyzed the key functionality that needs to be tested. Special attention was paid to:

1. **Displaying a list of vacancies**: Checking that all vacancies are displayed correctly when the page loads.
2. **Filter operation**: Testing the possibility of using different filters to customize the job list.
3. **Adaptability**: Checking the correct display of the page on mobile devices and when resizing the browser window.
4. **Job Search**: Make sure that the job search function is working correctly and provides relevant results.
5. **Accessibility of buttons and links**: Check the functionality of all buttons and links on the page.
6. **Performance**: Testing page loading with slow Internet connections and dynamic updating of the job list.

The test cases cover both basic and extreme cases to provide a comprehensive check of the page's functionality. Each test will be performed using a clear set of steps and expected results to confirm the correctness of the work.
